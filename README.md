## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to revising and practicing essential data structures and algorithms. It will contain:
- Code implementations of different data structures and algorithms.
- Solutions to various DSA problems.
- Notes and key concepts to aid in my understanding.

## Goals

- **Strengthen understanding of core DSA concepts**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Sorting Algorithms, etc.
- **Practice DSA problems regularly**: Solve problems from platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).
- **Improve problem-solving skills**: Enhance my approach towards solving challenging problems effectively and efficiently.

## Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
- Heaps
- Hash Maps / Hash Tables
- Graphs

## Algorithms

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Recursion and Backtracking

## Practice Problems

Below is a list of problems that I plan to solve or have solved during my revision:

- [x] Array: Find the maximum sum subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)
- [ ] Linked List: Reverse a linked list
- [ ] Tree: Find the height of a binary tree
- [ ] Graph: Implement Depth First Search (DFS)
- [ ] Dynamic Programming: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
